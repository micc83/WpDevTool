== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to enable Silent Logging =

WpDevTool can handle errors for you with the only downside that is fired at plugins activation. If you need a more complete logging and still use WpDevTool Error Console you can manually edit your wp-config.php file. Set WP_DEBUG constant to TRUE in your wp-config.php file and add the following lines of code right after :
`
if (WP_DEBUG) {
	define('WP_DEBUG_LOG', true);
	define('WP_DEBUG_DISPLAY', false);
	@ini_set('display_errors',0);
}
`
